                Deepfake.Report is intended to function as a landing page for the deepfake research community.
                It is connected internally to the Deepfake Wiki, and will host infographic content that displays
                an overview of the current state of research into deepfake generation and deepfake detection methods.
                This project has as its aim to reduce the overwhelming quantity of literature in this topic to
                some key take-aways, the central one being the areas of research where "defence" methods (i.e. deepfake
                detection methods) are currently being outpaced by the capabilities of generation methods, or
                "attack" methods once the literature takes on more of an "arms race" aspect.
